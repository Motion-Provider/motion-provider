# Motion Provider — Next.js Starter

_Animate your React components in seconds not hours with Motion Provider_. This repository is a starter template for **Next.js projects** pre-wired with Motion Provider tooling **\*LOCALLY**, which means you can observe the snippets and play with them. It comes with end-to-end type safety for complex motion logics.

---

## Why this starter?

This starter is built for engineers who want to ship delightful, high-performance motion experiences quickly:

- Minimal setup: opinionated defaults so you can prototype animations fast.
- TypeScript-first: safety and DX for complex motion logic.
- Tailwind CSS: utility-driven styling that pairs well with motion-based UI.
- Framer Motion-ready patterns: predictable, reusable motion primitives.
- LOCAL: no need for a separate package installation, just `npm run dev`.

## Features

- Next.js (TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS
- Example pages and components showcasing common motion patterns
- Basic build and deploy-ready configuration

## Tech stack

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Motion Provider

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ (LTS recommended)
- npm (or yarn/pnpm)

### Clone and install

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/Motion-Provider/motion-provider-nextjs-starter.git
cd motion-provider-nextjs-starter

# install
npm install
# or
# pnpm install
# yarn
```

### Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Build and preview

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
# or to preview the production build locally
npm run build && npm run start
```

### Deploy

This starter is compatible with common deployment platforms (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages). For Vercel, just import the repository and use the default build command (`npm run build`) and publish directory.

## Usage & examples

> Check out official playground [here](https://motionprovider.dev/) to see the real capabilities of Motion Provider.

The project includes example pages and components that demonstrate how to:

- Wrap your app with a Motion Provider (if present in the stack)
- Create reusable animation hooks and variants
- Animate route transitions and list items

A small illustrative example (replace with the project-specific API where applicable):

```tsx
/*
This code is generated by the playground 
engine and matches with the current state 
of the animation. You can copy&paste, 
ready-to-use in seconds!
*/
import { MotionContainer as Container } from "@/motion-provider";

export function MotionContainer_a81492() {
  return (
    <Container
      elementType="div"
      animation={{
        mode: ["fadeIn"],
        transition: "smooth",
        duration: 1,
        delay: 0,
      }}
      className="size-24 rounded-lg bg-stone-500"
    />
  );
}
```

> Tip: check the `src` folder for concrete examples and ready-to-use components.

Adjust these files to tune build-time and runtime behavior.

## Tests

This starter provides a place to add tests. Recommended tools:

- Jest + React Testing Library for unit testing components
- Playwright / Cypress for end-to-end tests

## Contributing

Contributions, issues, and feature requests are very welcome. Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "feat: add ..."`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/my-feature`)
5. Open a pull request

Please keep PRs focused and include screenshots or GIFs for visual changes.

## Troubleshooting

- If animations look janky, check for expensive renders or layout thrashing. Use React Profiler and the browser performance tab.
